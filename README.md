# MIT 6.034
These are the psets for the MITs introduction to Artificial Inttelligence course.
I have made all the python 2.x version code to a compaitable 3.x version using chat GPT,
Then tried to solve them on my own.
I do feel that the lack of tutorials videos made it difficult to understand ID trees and neural nets and I couldnt do the last pset as till now cause I couldnt get the new orange3 version running, maybe I might be able to get it working later on and then push that as well here
